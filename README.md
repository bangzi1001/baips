# BitAssets Improvement Proposal

BAIP stands for BitAssets Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an
improvement *consensus*. BitAssets are BitShares Committee's SmartCoins
including but not limited to BitCNY, BitUSD and BitBTC. A BAIP is a design document providing information to the
BitShares community, or describing a new feature for BitAssets or change its parameters
or price feed formula, logic and source. The BAIP should provide a concise technical specification of the
feature or the idea and a rationale for it. It may not only describe technical
improvements but also document *best-practises* and recommendations.

The distinct document [BAIP Purpose and Guidelines](baip-0001.md) gives a more
detailed explanation.
